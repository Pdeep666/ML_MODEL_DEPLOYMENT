# Rainfall Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various meteorological parameters that influence rainfall patterns. The model is trained to provide accurate rainfall predictions based on historical weather data.

## Features

- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outlier removal
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution
- Balancing the dataset to improve model performance
- Training and evaluating machine learning models (Random Forest Classifier)
- Flask-based API for serving predictions
- Visualization of results
- Model file and HTML interface included in the project folder

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Flask (for API development)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Usage

### Running on Google Colab
1. Upload the dataset (`Rainfall.csv`) to Google Colab.
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
3. Execute the cells step by step to preprocess data, train the model, and analyze results.
4. Save the trained model file for later use.


### Running the Flask API

1. Navigate to the directory containing the Flask app.
2. Run the Flask application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
3. The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Model Evaluation

- Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- The **Random Forest Classifier** is the primary model used.
- Performance is analyzed using visualization techniques.

## Results

The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics. The results are visualized using graphs and charts for better interpretation.
