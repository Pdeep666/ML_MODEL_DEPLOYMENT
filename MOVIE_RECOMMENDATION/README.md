# Netflix Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project focuses on building a **Netflix Movie Recommendation System** using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to suggest movies based on popularity, language, and user preferences to enhance user experience and engagement.

## Business Problem

With a vast library of movies, Netflix users often struggle to find relevant content. A recommendation system helps by analyzing past user behavior and movie attributes to provide personalized suggestions. This improves user satisfaction and increases watch time, benefiting both users and Netflix.

## Key Insights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Identified top **10 languages** with the highest movie count.
  - Analyzed **average popularity by language** to find the most-watched content.
  - Examined **movie status** (released, upcoming, etc.).
  - Determined top directors based on **average popularity** of their movies.
  - Found movies with **highest revenue** and **highest vote count**.
- **Recommendation System**:
  - Implemented a **content-based recommendation system** using **cosine similarity**.
  - Developed a model to suggest movies based on genre, director, and popularity.
  - Utilized **Count Vectorizer** for text-based recommendations.

## Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning modeling)
- **Flask** (for building the web application)
- **HTML & CSS** (for frontend design)
- **Google Colab** (for execution and analysis)
